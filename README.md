## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: ADB Connection Issues

If you encounter a problem connecting your TV (for example: cannot connect to [IP address]:5555,
or adb.exe not compatible with Windows error), it may be related to the version of ADB included.

To fix it:
You can manually replace the adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll, and AdbWinUsbApi.dll files in the Toolkit's adb folder with the latest version from: https://adbdownload.com/ or directly from the official Google platform-tools if you prefer: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools

Steps to update ADB manually:

Download the latest ADB tools.

Copy adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll, and AdbWinUsbApi.dll.

Replace the existing files in the adb folder inside the Toolkit directory.

After replacing, try connecting your TV again through the Toolkit.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è About the EXE

The run_toolkit.exe included in this project was built from the open-source run_toolkit.pyw script using PyInstaller.

If you prefer, you can rebuild the EXE yourself using the following steps:
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed run_toolkit.pyw

This project is fully open-source ‚Äî nothing hidden.

You can review, modify, or rebuild the Toolkit freely based on your needs.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è macOS Compatibility

The `run_toolkit.py` script is fully cross-platform and should work on macOS with:

- **Python 3.8 or later**
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip3 install PySimpleGUI

- Install ADB: brew install android-platform-tools
- Run the toolkit: python3 path/to/run_toolkit.py

A native .app version is not yet available, but we‚Äôre looking for community testers to help build one!
